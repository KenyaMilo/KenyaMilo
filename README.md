- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KenyaMilo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Computer Science student with a passion for coding and learning new technologies. 
- I have intermediate experience with Java and I am diving into C++ this semester.
- When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in a good book, catching up on the latest anime, or enjoying a peaceful walk.
- Let's connect and share our tech journeys!
